# Portfolio Website (Sketch-matched)

Open `start-here.html` (or serve with a local server) and you’ll see each page laid out to match your hand-drawn sketches.

## Run locally
- VS Code: Live Server extension
- Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit `/start-here.html`

## Replace images
Put your real assets in `/assets/images/` and update the `<img src="...">` references.

## Navigation behavior
- Desktop: hover the hamburger to open the dropdown; hover “Recent Clients” to open the adjacent submenu.
- Mobile: tap the hamburger to open; tap “Recent Clients” to expand.

## Notes
Headings and paragraph labels are kept exactly as written in the sketches (e.g., “Header (H2)”, “paragraph <p>”).
